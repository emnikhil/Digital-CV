## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager
- streamilt : ```pip install streamlit```

### Steps to Use

## 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Digital-CV.git
cd Digital-CV
```
## 2. Replace assets and photos
   
Update the images and certificates inside the assets/ folder with your own images and files.

## 3. Update your details
   
Modify the Python files inside the ```sections/ directory``` to update your personal information, skills, experience, projects, and certificates.
Update ```config.py``` with your project and certificate details.

## 4. Steps to implement email sending with your contact form:

Setup: Allow Gmail SMTP access
   
Use a Gmail account to send emails.
  
Create an App Password (recommended) if you have 2FA enabled on your Google account:
  
```https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833```
  
Or allow "Less secure app access" (not recommended).

## 5. Configure email for contact form
   
Create or update the ```.streamlit/secrets.toml``` file (or use the existing one) with your email credentials for the contact form to function correctly.

```
[email]
address = "your.email@example.com"
password = "your_email_password"
```

## 6. Run the app on local

```
python3 -u portfolio/app.py
python3 -m streamlit run app.py
```

## 7. Open in your browser
   
Visit ```http://localhost:8501``` (or the URL Streamlit provides) to see your digital CV in action.
