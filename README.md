## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager
- streamlit : ```pip install streamlit```

### Steps to Use

## 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Digital-CV.git
cd Digital-CV
```
## 2. Replace assets and photos
   
Update the images and certificates inside the assets/ folder with your own files.

## 3. Update your details
   
Modify the Python files inside the ```sections/``` directory to update your personal information, skills, experience, projects, and certificates.
Update ```config.py``` with your project, work history and certificate details.

## 4. Steps to implement email sending with your contact form:

- Setup: Allow Gmail SMTP access  
- Use a Gmail account to send emails.  
- Create an App Password (recommended) if you have 2FA enabled on your Google account:
   
       https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833    
   
  Or allow "Less secure app access" (not recommended).

## 5. Configure email for contact form
   
Create ```.streamlit/secrets.toml``` file with your email credentials for the contact form to work:

```
[email]
address = "your.email@example.com"
password = "your_email_password"
```

## 6. Run the app on local

```
python -u portfolio/app.py

streamlit run app.py
```

OR - if Python not added to ```PATH```

```
python3 -u portfolio/app.py

python3 -m streamlit run app.py
```

## 7. Open in your browser
   
Visit ```http://localhost:8501``` (or the URL Streamlit provides) to see your digital CV in action.

## 8. Prevent Streamlit app from going to sleep

Steps:

- In your forked repository, go to .github/workflows/keep_alive.yml
- Replace the placeholder app ```URL``` with your actual ```Streamlit app URL```

```yaml
name: Keep Streamlit App Awake

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */3 * * *'

jobs:
  keep-alive:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Curl your Streamlit app
        run: curl -s --head https://nikhilgupta.streamlit.app || true
```
